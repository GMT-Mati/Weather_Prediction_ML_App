## Project Overview
The Weather Prediction App is an ambitious project designed to provide users with reliable weather predictions while fostering a sense of community and climate awareness. Here's a brief overview of the project's goals and key features:

- **Accurate Predictions:** Our app leverages state-of-the-art machine learning models and real-time data to provide accurate weather predictions.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** We have developed an intuitive and user-friendly interface that allows users to easily access weather information and make informed decisions.

- **Community Engagement:** We encourage user contributions, feedback, and engagement to enrich our platform and promote a sense of community among users.

- **Climate Awareness:** We are committed to raising awareness about climate change and environmental responsibility through our platform.

## Getting Started
To get started with the Weather Prediction App, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Set up your development environment by installing Python, required libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, Flask), and a code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code).

3. Explore the project folders:
   - `data`: Contains subfolders for raw and processed data.
